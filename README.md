# ![](img/treehouse.png) Team Treehouse - Project 2 - Mobile-first Responsive Layout

This is my second project for the [Front End Web Development Techdegree at Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/front-end-web-development).

### Description
Creating a responsive webpage with in-page links using the mobile-first approach.

## Overview
  
### About this project
Users should be able to :
* View this web page on 3 different devices:
  * Moble (320px viewport)
  * Tablet (768px vieport)
  * Desktop (1024px viewport)
- Be able to use the navigation to jump to the linked sections of the webpage.
- **Exceeds:** Add an additional section such as Skills.
- **Exceeds:** Add an additional Google font.
- **Exceeds:** Add a new background colour for the navigation or main section of the site.
- **Exceeds:** Change the colour of at least one piece of text.
- **Exceeds:** Add an additional image for the profile image.
- **Exceeds:** Add additional styling for links.

## My Process
First, I read through all the requirements for this project.
Then used the mobile mockup to structure the HTML for the entire page.
I also referred to my notes taken through some CSS courses. 

### Technoliges Used
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first layout
- Photoshop for my profile image

### What I learned
Initially, the **Float** property was recommened to be used for the layout within the media queries. Due to becoming frustrated using the CSS **Float** property, I quickly ran through the **Flexbox** course and learnt **Flexbox** for the first time.
I also learnt how to convert a font to different formats and use the ```@font-face``` to import a font family that is possibly not on a user's computer. In so doing a learnt the difference between:
* TrueType Fonts (TTF)
  * TrueType is a font standard developed in the late 1980s, by Apple and Microsoft. TrueType is the most common font format for both the Mac OS and Microsoft Windows operating systems.

* Embedded OpenType Fonts (EOT)
  * EOT fonts are a compact form of OpenType fonts designed by Microsoft for use as embedded fonts on web pages.

* SVG Fonts/Shapes
  * SVG fonts allow SVG to be used as glyphs when displaying text. The SVG 1.1 specification define a font module that allows the creation of fonts within an SVG document. You can also apply CSS to SVG documents, and the @font-face rule can be applied to text in SVG documents.

* The Web Open Font Format (WOFF)

  * WOFF is a font format for use in web pages. It was developed in 2009, and is now a W3C Recommendation. WOFF is essentially OpenType or TrueType with compression and additional metadata. The goal is to support font distribution from a server to a client over a network with bandwidth constraints.

* The Web Open Font Format (WOFF 2.0)

  * TrueType/OpenType font that provides better compression than WOFF 1.0. 

### Continued Development

A better understanding of **Flexbox** for future projects, as I felt I rushed a little too much through the course.


### Resources
- [Animated Cheatsheet for Flexbox](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/flexbox-the-ultimate-css-flex-cheatsheet/) - This gave me an excellent visual understanding of the different properties and values for **Flexbox**.

## Acknowledgments
While completing this project, I learned just how amazing our FEWD Slack channel community of students of this Techdegree are. It was the suggestion of one student to use **Flexbox**, and several students complimented me on the styling of my project, which kick started the growth of confidence in my **CSS** skills.
